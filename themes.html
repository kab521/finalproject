    <h1>Ignorance is Bliss</h1>
    When Captain Beatty explains to Montag why people choose to burn/ban books from society, he says that it causes unhappiness and inequality. They are overwhelmed and scared of trying to understand what is in them. They prefer a world where they don't have to deal with such things, choosing instead a passive life of ignorance. This is personified through Mildred. She chooses not to care about books, and when her friend cried at the poem read by Montag, she reports him to get rid of the pain, which she thinks is the books. Montag also brings up politics, and the candidate’s beliefs. Mildred’s friends only planned on voting for the candidate due to his attractiveness, rather than knowing anything about him. They destroy the books in order to "protect" everyone from knowledge. This theme illustrates how quickly ignorance can spread, condemning people to a life of deliberate ignorance and guaranteeing that future generations will not have access to information from the past.

    <div class="JH">
        <h1>Knowledge as Power</h1>
        The government outlaws owning books, even though society was voluntarily giving up books. Bradbury emphasizes that by getting people to give up their access to knowledge, it can benefit anyone who would want those same people in a inferior role. People in power do not want others  to have access to knowledge, as it could potentially have them challenge the way things are. This leads to censorship. Those in power easily maintain control when books are outlawed, as people cannot access knowledge.

        <div class="JH">
            <h1>Media as Ignorance</h1>
            The opposite of books are the media, specifically TV. Media represents ignorance, as the characters use it to replace their individuality and willingness to engage in independent thought. The government strategically uses media as a way for people to be comforted and have instant gratification to keep them focused rather than reality. Distraction is meant to lose the character’s connection to the real world.

            <div class="JH">
                <h1>Technology's Negative Impact</h1>
                Fahrenheit 451 shows readers the negative impact of technology's effects on society. Those who watch television are hypnotized by it, as their senses dulled to the point that they are incapable of thinking critically or freely. Firefighters burn books with a flamethrower as an illustration of situational irony, since they are literally destroying knowledge. When someone disagrees, robotic dogs are able to track them down, and nuclear technology destroys humanity as a whole at the very end.
