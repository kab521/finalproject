    <h1>Characterization Through Speech Pattern</h1>
    The speech pattern of those who are the consumer society, such as Mildred and her friends, is bland and lacking in personality due to their “spiritual emptiness and intellectual primitiveness.” Language is meant to be reflective of your priorities and societal values, and Bradbury paints the consumer society as such through “incomplete sentences, cliches, and excessive tag-questions.” This was meant to demonstrate the resemblance between empty thoughts and poor syntax.
</div><br>

<div class="CC">
    <h1><em>Examples</em></h1>
    <li>"Oh, they come and go, come and go," said Mrs. Phelps. [Mildred’s friend] "In again out again Finnegan, the Army called Pete yesterday. He'll be back next week. The Army said so. Quick war. Forty-eight hours they said, and everyone home. That's what the Army said. Quick war. Pete was called yesterday and they said he'd be back next week. Quick ..."
<br><br>
   <li> "I'm not worried." said Mrs. Phelps. "I'll let Pete do all the worrying," She giggled. "I'll let old Pete do all the worrying. Not me. I'm not worried." (103)<br><br><li>"I think she's [Clarisse]  gone."

    "Gone?"
    
    "Whole family moved out somewhere. But she's gone for good. I think she's dead."
    
    "We couldn't be talking about the same girl."
    
    "No. The same girl. McClellan. McClellan. Run over by a car. Four days ago. I'm not sure. But I think she's dead. The family moved out anyway. I don't know. But I think she's dead."
    
    "You're not sure of it!"
    
    "No, not sure. Pretty sure."
    
    "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"
    
    "Forgot."
    
    "Four days ago!"
    
    "I forgot all about it." (66)</div><br>



    <div class="JH">
        <h1>Tag-questions</h1>
        Tag questions are questions usually followed by a confirming question. Those in power of the consumer society require reassurance. Captain Beatty uses this a lot, trying to create an allure that society is fine and almost fun. He tries too hard to make Montag and other firemen think that their society is the peaceful and content to ensure that they maintain their roles. The overuse of tag-questions demonstrates how artificial and fake things are in this society. Professor Faber, on the other hand, holds genuine human values and never uses tag-questions. 
    <br><br><em><strong>“Immortality of knowledge and art needs no confirmation. it exists objectively and fills life with meaning and purpose.” </strong></em>
    </div>
   <br> 

   <div class="CC">
    <h1><em>Examples</em></h1>
   <li> Beatty: "You like baseball. don't you, Montag?"
<br>
    "Baseball's a fine game."
   <br> 
    Beatty went on as if nothing had happened. "You like bowling. don't you, Montag?" (73)
    <br><br>
    <li>Beatty: "Ask yourself. What do we want in this country. above all? People want to be happy. isn't that right? I want to be happy. people say. Well. aren't they? Don't we keep them moving. don't we give them fun? That's all we live for. isn't it? For pleasure. for titillation? And you must admit our culture provides plenty of these." (75-76)</div><br>
