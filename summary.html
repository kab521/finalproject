    <p class="lol">Fahrenheit 451 is widely known for its themes about being against censorship and the importance of literature. The story’s setting is the future in a city. Guy Montag, the main character, is a fireman whose job is to burn down any houses that own books, and the books themselves. After leaving work one day, he meets Clarisse, who asks if he is happy. When he comes home after that conversation, He discovers that Mildred, his wife, attempted suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. She is later revived after he calls for two men to help her. The next morning, she acts as if nothing ever happened and watches the massive television screens that make up three of the walls inside their house. Montag and Clarisse start to have regular conversations after work, until he realizes that she does not wait for him one day. He eventually learns that she passes away in a car accident. On a mission at work, Montag watches as an elderly woman chooses to die with her books in the fire. This event leads to the start of where Montag feels as if his job is morally wrong. As a result, he stashes away her bible. Captain Beatty, the firehouse captain, visits Montag. This is where Captain Beatty explains the history of the dystopia. Long ago, people started to lose interest in reading after television was invented. He also mentions that in order to offend less people, books increasingly became banned, which led to censorship. People thought that books and learning lead to inequality and unhappiness. After Beatty leaves, Montag tells Mildred that he has hidden many books. They read, and Montag struggles, while Mildred prefers TV. Later, Montag meets with an old English professor, named Faber. Montag asks Faber to teach him how to read books, and Faber agrees. After coming back, Montag reads some poetry to Mildred ad her friends. One starts to cry, while the other is angered, saying that this is why books are banned. Mildred reports Montag for owning books, and at work he is surprised when he is told that it is his house that needs to be burned down. Captain Beatty pressures Montag to burn his house down, and Montag replies by using his flamethrower on Beatty. Montag escapes by following railroad lines to the countryside after asking Faber what to do. Montag manages to avoid the manhunt that is after him when far from home, he meets a group of men around a bonfire. One named Granger informs him that each of them has memorized a book to use the knowledge to rebuild society. They watch as bombs destroy the city. </p></center>
