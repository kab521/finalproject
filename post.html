<div class="JH">
    <h1>Fragmented Lines and Nonlinear Storytelling</h1>
    The structure of "Fahrenheit 451" is really unique. There are a bunch of flashbacks, dream sequences, and awkwardly structured scenes. This type of narrative style is reflective of the odd form of story telling that is associated with postmodernism. Rather than writing a sequenced story, Bradbury might do this in order to have readers to question the nature of reality.

<div class="JH">
    <h1>Illusion</h1>
    Reality is often changed by the falsehoods and the manipulation of information by the government in the story. Montag found it hard to figure out the truth when media manipulation plays a big role in society. This might reflect post modernism as understanding reality and whats real and what’s not in a story plays a big part in post modernism.

<div class="JH">
    <h1>Intertextuality</h1>   
    Postmodern literature references other texts, blurring the lines between fiction and reality. "Fahrenheit 451" contains numerous literary allusions. Montag steals a Bible, they reference Shakespeare's plays, and they reference a ton of James Boswell’s works. These allusions contribute to the novel's commentary on the importance of literature and the dangers of its suppression.</div><br>
